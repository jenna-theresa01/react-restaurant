            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Books & Bites, we are so happy you have come to see us! Books & bite was founded when our founders wanted to go out and read at a library or bookstore but no place was open. So we figured, why not combine the love of reading with some good food? The main thing you should know about Books & Bites is that we are open 24/7. We want people to come in whenever they please and enjoy a atmosphere alone, or with friends, where you can sit and read in a comfortable place. So kick back, get some good food, and enjoy your reading time.</p>
            <p>We offer a wide variety of books within or little cafe that you can checkout while your here, or even buy if you want to enjoy the book for longer! Any questions, please feel free to <a href="../components/organisms/contactPage.js">contact us</a>, or you can always come talk talk to us inside!</p>
